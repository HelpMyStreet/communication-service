<p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

<p>
    Thank you for verifying your identity with Help My Street.
</p>
<p>
    Now you’re verified you’ll be able to start accepting requests in your area, just log in to your profile on helpmystreet.org and take a look at the ‘Open Requests’ tab to see requests for help in your area. We’ll also email you when new requests come in near you.
</p>
<p>
    Once you’ve accepted a request it will appear in the ‘My Accepted Requests’ tab so you can keep track of your open requests. From here you can mark a request as complete, or if needed, return it to the open requests tab for other volunteers to pick up. If you believe a request can’t be completed by any volunteer, perhaps the contact details don’t work or the request is no longer needed, let us know by contacting requests@helpmystreet.org.
</p>
<p>
    It might take some time for people to start using our site, but please keep an eye out for incoming requests. We’re starting to go bigger with our publicity and we hope to be helping lots of people near you very soon. And if there’s someone you’re worried about, please do submit a request – if we haven’t got an area covered we’ve got a dedicated team ready to find volunteers.
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, we’d really like to hear from you – if you have any feedback about our site, the registration journey, or what you’d like to see next contact us now by replying to this email or contacting feedback@helpmystreet.org.
</p>
<p>
    Best wishes,
</p>
<p>
    From the Help My Street Team
</p>
