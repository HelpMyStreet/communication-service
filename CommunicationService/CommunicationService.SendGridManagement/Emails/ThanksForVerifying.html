<p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

<p>Thank you for verifying your identity with HelpMyStreet!</p>

<p>Now you’re verified, you’ll be able to start accepting more of the requests for help coming through in your area. Please visit your <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/open-requests">Open Requests</a> tab to see who's currently in need of help, and make sure to keep an eye on your inbox for email updates.</p>

<p>Once you’ve accepted a request, it will appear in your <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/my-requests">My Requests</a> tab, so you can keep track of your accepted requests. From here you can mark a request as complete or click ‘Can’t Do’ to let us know if there’s a problem.</p>

<p>Please be aware that some requests may require additional checks before you can accept them. More information is available when you click to accept a request.</p>

<p>Thanks again for volunteering with us.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>The HelpMyStreet Team</p>

<p>P.S. Don’t forget that you can submit a request for help at any time if there’s someone far away from home that you’re worried about. Complete our <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/request-help">Request Help</a> form form and let us know what they need.</p>
