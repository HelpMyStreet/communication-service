{{#if_eq Activity "Face Covering"}} 
<p>Thank you for requesting a face covering through Help My Street. We hope to find a volunteer available in your area very soon. We ask that you consider the following when speaking to your volunteer:</p>
<br /><ul>
    <li>Homemade face coverings are not medical grade PPE, they are intended to be used by the public in enclosed public spaces and not for any other purpose.</li>
    <li>Face coverings do not replace the things we should all be doing to reduce our risk of contracting the virus, like hand-washing, social distancing, adhering to lock-down measures and self-isolating (where needed).</li>
    <li>Volunteers may charge a small amount to cover the costs of materials (and postage if required), but are offering their time and skills for free. Each mask takes around half an hour to produce, and then needs washing and packing before it can be sent to you!</li>
    <li>A face covering should be used properly to minimise the risk of infection and maximise any benefit it may have. You can find more information in the Government’s guidance on wearing a face covering (found <a href='https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering'>here</a>).</li>
    <li>Our volunteers are home-sewers and as face coverings are in high demand it may take a few days to fulfil your request. Large orders or those with specific requirements may take a little longer. For orders of more than 10 face coverings we split the request up into batches of 10 or fewer to help volunteers keep on top of demand - please note, any status updates you receive will relate to individual batches of up to ten face coverings and not the entire request. </li>
    <li>If you have any specific requirements for your face covering let your volunteer know when they contact you - we don’t require our volunteers to use a specific pattern or style so it’s important you check what they can offer is suitable.</li>
    <li>For hygiene reasons you cannot return a face covering once it has been delivered to you.</li>
    </ul>
<p>If after reviewing this you don’t think a homemade face-covering is right for you, don’t worry, just let the volunteer know when they get in touch and they’ll close your request.</p>"
{{else}}
<p>We have passed your request on to local volunteers, who will try to contact you as soon as they can, to let you know if they can help you (or arrange help for you).  If you don’t hear back within a day or two, do try again, or contact us via support@helpmystreet.org and we’ll try to see if there’s been a problem.</p>
