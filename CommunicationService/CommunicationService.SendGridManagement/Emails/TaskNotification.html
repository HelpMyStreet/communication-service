<div><span style='font-size: 14px;'><br>As Street Champion for this postcode, it would be great if you could help to ensure that someone responds to the request, even if you aren't able to do so yourself. You can find the contact details of other Street Champions and helpers that cover your postcodes in your <a href='http://www.helpmystreet.org/account/streets'>My Streets page</a>.</span></div>

{{#if IsNotVerified}}
<div><span style='font-size: 14px;'><br>Note: As you’re not yet verified, you’ll need to do that before you can accept requests or see more details. It only takes a few minutes though – and helps to keep everyone safe.

<div><span style='font-size: 14px;'><br>P.S. If you visit the site and this request is no longer visible, it’s probably been accepted by another user. Take a look around to see if there is anything else you can help with or keep an eye open for future notifications.</span></div>
