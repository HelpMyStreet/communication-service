<p>
    When you’re ready to start helping, you can view our open requests (and any other open requests near you) in the <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/open-requests">Open Requests</a> tab in your profile. We’ll also send you notifications when new opportunities are available - so make sure to keep an eye on your inbox!
</p>

<p>
    Once you’ve accepted a request it will appear in your <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/my-requests">My Requests</a> tab. From here, you can mark it as complete, or let us know if there’s a problem by clicking ‘Can’t Do’.
</p>

<p>Thanks again for volunteering with us. We hope you enjoy being a part of {{GroupName}}.</p>

<p>P.S. Don’t forget that you can submit a request for help at any time. If the person who needs help is in {{GroupLocation}} you can submit a request to {{GroupName}} by completing our <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/request-help/{{EncodedGroupId}}">Request Help</a> form. If they’re further afield (or we don’t have the type of volunteers you need) you can also <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/request-help">Request Help</a> from HelpMyStreet, but please be aware that their requests will be visible to other volunteers and won’t be managed by {{GroupName}}.</p>
