    If you haven’t done it already, you may like to complete your online ID verification now. We’ve made it as quick and easy as possible with the help of our partner, Yoti. Click <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/profile">here</a> to launch your profile and get verified.
</p>
<p>
    Most requests on our platform require ID verification to give people in need of help the confidence you are who you say you are. Some of our partner organisations may also require additional checks, if this is the case we’ll let you know when you click to accept a request.

<p>When you’re ready to start helping, you can view our open requests (and any other open requests near you) in the <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/open-requests">Open Requests</a> tab in your profile - make sure to keep an eye on your inbox for email updates.</p>

<p>Once you’ve accepted a request, it will appear in your <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/my-requests">My Requests</a> tab. From here, you can mark it as complete, or let us know if there’s a problem by clicking ‘Can’t Do’.</p>

<p>Thanks again for volunteering with us. We hope you enjoy being a part of {{GroupName}}.</p>
