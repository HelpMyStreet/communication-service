<p>When you’re ready to start helping, you can view our open requests (and any other open requests near you) in the <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/open-requests">Open Requests</a> tab in your profile - make sure to keep an eye on your inbox for email updates.</p>

<p>Once you’ve accepted a request, it will appear in your <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/my-requests">My Requests</a> tab. From here, you can mark it as complete, or let us know if there’s a problem by clicking ‘Can’t Do’.</p>

<p>Thanks again for volunteering with us. We hope you enjoy being a part of {{GroupName}}.</p>
