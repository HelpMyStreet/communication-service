<p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

<p>Thanks for registering with HelpMyStreet to help people in need. Volunteers like you are making a real difference in your communities by helping people stay safe. Everyone at HelpMyStreet is grateful to you for taking care of them.</p>

<p>Please log on at HelpMyStreet.org and look at the ‘Open Requests’ tab <a href="http://www.helpmystreet.org/account/open-requests">here</a> in your profile to see who's currently in need of help. We’ll also email you when new Help Requests come in near you.</p>

<p>Once you’ve accepted a request, it will appear in the ‘My Accepted Requests’ tab <a href="http://www.helpmystreet.org/account/accepted-requests">here</a> so you can keep track of your accepted requests. From here you can mark a request as complete, or if needed, return it for other volunteers to pick up. If you see a request that can’t be completed, e.g. the contact details don’t work or the request is no longer needed, please let us know by contacting requests@helpmystreet.org.</p>

<p>It might take some time for people to start using our site, but please keep an eye out for incoming requests for help. We hope to be helping lots of people near you very soon. And if there’s someone you’re worried about, anywhere in the UK, please submit a Help Request for them – if we haven’t already got that area covered we have a dedicated team ready to find volunteers across the country.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback about our site, the registration journey, or what you’d like to see next, please email us: <a href="mailto:feedback@helpmystreet.org">feedback@helpmystreet.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks again for being part of our community and helping people in need.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>Help My Street Team</p>
