    <p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

    <p>
        Thanks for being one of the first people to register with HelpMyStreet!
    </p>
    <p>
        We've built a platform to make volunteering easier and safer. At the moment we can match volunteers to people who need help, but there is much more coming soon..
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the coming weeks we are looking to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update the request for help form to include questions tailored to each activity type – helping to collect more of the information you need up front</li>
        <li>Allow users to track their requests for help so they know what is going on</li>
        <li>Prioritise incoming requests to ensure the most important and time-sensitive are dealt with first</li>
        <li>Release interactive maps so users can see where help is needed in their area</li>
        <li>Introduce groups so you can show your support for voluntary groups which are already doing great work in your community</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To find open requests go to the ‘Open Requests’ tab in your profile. We’ll also email you when new requests come in near you. Once you’ve accepted a request it will appear in the ‘My Accepted Requests’ tab so you can keep track of your open requests. From here you can mark a request as complete, or if needed, return it to the open requests tab for other volunteers to pick up. If you believe a request can’t be completed by any volunteer, perhaps the contact details don’t work or the request is no longer needed, let us know by contacting requests@helpmystreet.org.
    </p>
    <p>
        It might take some time for people to start using our site, but please keep an eye out for incoming requests. We’re starting to go bigger with our publicity and we hope to be helping lots of people near you very soon. And if there’s someone you’re worried about, please do submit a request – if we haven’t got an area covered we’ve got a dedicated team ready to find volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the meantime, we’d really like to hear from you – if you have any feedback about our site, the registration journey, or what you’d like to see next contact us now by replying to this email or contacting feedback@helpmystreet.org.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks again for being part of our community. We hope to hear from you soon!
    </p>
    <p>
        Best wishes,
    </p>
    <p>
        From the Help My Street Team
