<p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

<p>Thanks so much for volunteering to help with <strong>{{Activity}}</strong> at <strong>{{Location}}</strong> via HelpMystreet.org.</p>

<p>This is just a quick reminder for your upcoming shift:</p>

<p>Start: <strong>{{ShiftStartDateString}}</strong></p>

<p>End: <strong>{{ShiftEndDateString}}</strong></p>

<p>Location: <strong>{{Location}}</strong> <strong>{{LocationAddress}}</strong></p>

<p>You can find all the details you need in the request <a href='{{BaseUrl}}/link/{{JobUrlToken}}'>here</a>. Please make sure you have read all available information, including the volunteer instruction, before arriving for your shift.</p>

<p>If you’re having problems please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:support@helpmystreet.org">support@helpmystreet.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re no longer able to complete the request, please “release” it by clicking the “Can’t Do” button beside it in your <a href='{{BaseUrl}}/account/my-shifts'>My Shifts</a> tab. It is important you do this at the earliest opportunity if you are no longer to help so we can make the shift available to other volunteers and let the venue know not to expect you.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your help!</p>

<p>
    The HelpMyStreet team
