    If your face coverings aren’t with you already, then they should be on their way, possibly being hand delivered or in the post. If you haven’t received them after 5 days, please let us know by contacting <a href="mailto:support@helpmystreet.org">support@helpmystreet.org</a>.

<p>This means a volunteer has seen and accepted your request.  You may hear from them soon if there’s anything they need to arrange with you.  If you have any questions, or if you need to change or cancel the request, please do contact us at <a href="mailto:support@helpmystreet.org">support@helpmystreet.org</a>.</p>

{{#if IsOpen}}
<p>This probably means that the volunteer who had accepted it is now unable to complete it.  It is visible to other volunteers again and will hopefully be accepted soon by one of them.  As soon as it is, you’ll be notified.  Thanks for your patience.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, or if you need to change or cancel the request, please do contact us at <a href="mailto:support@helpmystreet.org">support@helpmystreet.org</a>.
