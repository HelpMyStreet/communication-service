<p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

<p>Thanks for registering with HelpMyStreet to help people in need. Volunteers like you are making a real difference in your communities by helping people stay safe.</p>

<p>Can we help with your ID Verification?</p>

<p>HelpMyStreet.org has chosen to partner with Yoti to verify the identity of our volunteers. Yoti is a trusted digital identification service that provides a fast, secure and free way to verify your identity. You can find out more about ID verification and Yoti in our FAQs.</p>

<p>Once you’ve completed your ID Verification in the Yoti app, please go back to helpmystreet.org to complete your registration. Just log in at the top of the page with your email address and password - you won’t need to re-start the process as you’ll be taken straight back to where you left off.</p>

<p>If there's a problem and you’re unable to verify your identity, let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:feedback@helpmystreet.org">feedback@helpmystreet.org</a>. Please don’t create a second Yoti account or HelpMyStreet account.</p>

<p>When you're verified, you'll be able to receive help requests from people in your area. To find open requests go to the ‘Open Requests’ tab <a href="http://www.helpmystreet.org/account/open-requests">here</a> in your profile. We’ll also email you when new requests come in near you. Once you’ve accepted a request it will appear in the ‘My Accepted Requests’ tab <a href="http://www.helpmystreet.org/account/accepted-requests">here</a> so you can keep track of your open requests</p>

<p>If you have any feedback about our site, the registration journey, or what you’d like to see next, please email us: <a href="mailto:feedback@helpmystreet.org">feedback@helpmystreet.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks again for being part of our community and helping people in need.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>Help My Street Team</p>
