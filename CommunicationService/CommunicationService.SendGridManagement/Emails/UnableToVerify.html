    <p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

    <p>
        It looks like you weren't able to complete your ID verification through Yoti. Can we help?
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you’ve got your Yoti set up you can go back to helpmystreet.org to complete your registration at any time – just log in at the top of the page with your email address and password. You won’t need to re-start the process as you’ll be taken straight back to where you left off. You can only use your Yoti once, so if you've already registered you won't be able to verify with a second account.
    </p>
    <p>
        HelpMyStreet.org has chosen to partner with Yoti and verify the identity of our volunteers to help protect our users, including volunteers and the people they help. Yoti is a trusted digital identification service that provides a fast, secure and free way to verify your identity. You can find out more about ID verification and Yoti in our FAQs.

    <p>
        Once you're verified you'll be able to receive help requests from people in your area. To find open requests go to the ‘Open Requests’ tab in your profile. We’ll also email you when new requests come in near you. Once you’ve accepted a request it will appear in the ‘My Accepted Requests’ tab so you can keep track of your open requests.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there has been a problem and you’re unable to complete your registration let us know by replying to this email or contacting feedback@helpmystreet.org. We’d love you to be a part of our community to help your street.
    </p>

        Best wishes,
    </p>
