<p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

<p>Thanks for registering with HelpMyStreet to help people in need. Volunteers like you are making a real difference in your communities by helping people stay safe.</p>

<p>It looks like you weren't able to complete your ID verification through Yoti. Can we help?</p>

<p>
    This is most often due to a mis-match between the details you entered when you set up your HelpMyStreet account and those from your photo ID in the Yoti app. Most commonly, it’s date of birth.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Try checking the date of birth on your <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/profile">My Profile</a> tab and comparing it to the one in the Yoti app (in the “Personal Details” section)</li>
    <li>If the HelpMyStreet version needs correcting, or if you’re having any other difficulties, just let us know on <a href="mailto:support@helpmystreet.org">support@helpmystreet.org</a> and we’ll do all we can to help</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’re verified you’ll be able to start accepting more of the requests for help coming through in your area. To find open requests go to the <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/open-requests">Open Requests</a> tab in your profile and keep an eye on your inbox for email updates.</p>

<p>Please be aware that some requests may require additional checks before you can accept them. More information is available when you click to accept a request.</p>

<p>Thanks again for volunteering with us.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>The HelpMyStreet Team</p>

<p>P.S. Don’t forget that you can submit a request for help at any time if there’s someone far away from home that you’re worried about. Complete our <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/request-help">Request Help</a> form and let us know what they need.</p>
