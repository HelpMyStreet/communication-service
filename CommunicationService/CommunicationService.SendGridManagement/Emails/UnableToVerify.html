<p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

<p>Thanks for registering with HelpMyStreet to help people in need. Volunteers like you are making a real difference in your communities by helping people stay safe.</p>

<p>It looks like you weren't able to complete your ID verification through Yoti. Can we help?</p>

<p>
    This is most often due to a mis-match between the details you entered when you set up your HelpMyStreet account and those from your photo ID in the Yoti app. Most commonly, it’s date of birth.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Try checking the date of birth on your <a href="http://www.helpmystreet.org/account/profile">My Profile</a> tab and comparing it to the one in the Yoti app (in the “Personal Details” section)</li>
    <li>If the HelpMyStreet version needs correcting, or if you’re having any other difficulties, just let us know on <a href="mailto:support@helpmystreet.org">support@helpmystreet.org</a> and we’ll do all we can to help</li>
</ul>

<p>When you're verified, you'll be able to receive help requests from people in your area. To find open requests go to the <a href="http://www.helpmystreet.org/account/open-requests">Open Requests</a> tab in your profile. We’ll also email you when new requests come in near you.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback about our site, the registration journey, or what you’d like to see next, please email us: <a href="mailto:feedback@helpmystreet.org">feedback@helpmystreet.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks again for being part of our community and helping people in need.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>The Help My Street Team</p>
