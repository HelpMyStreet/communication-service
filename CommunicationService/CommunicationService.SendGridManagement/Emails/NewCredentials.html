<p>Hi {{VolunteerFirstName}},</p>

<p>Good news!</p>

<p>
    Your {{CredentialName}} for {{GroupName}} has been updated on HelpMyStreet.
    {{#if CredentialsWillExpire}} This is due to expire {{ExpiryDate}}. {{/if}}
</p>

<p>Just so you know, credentials added by {{GroupName}} can only be used to verify you for {{GroupName}} requests. If you accept a request for another organisation or group you may need to complete additional checks.</p>

<p>Thanks for using HelpMyStreet!.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>The HelpMyStreet Team</p>
