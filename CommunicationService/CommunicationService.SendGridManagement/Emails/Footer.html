    HelpMyStreet is working with community organisers to get help and support to people who need to shelter safely at home. Many of
    these people live far from friends and family and don't have a local support network. HelpMyStreet gets the right help to the right
    people so that no one is left out. All volunteers are ID verified so that everyone is safe and secure. Request help or sign up as a
    volunteer at <a href="http://helpmystreet.org" target="_blank">helpmystreet.org</a>.
