<p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

<p>Thanks for registering with HelpMyStreet to help people in need. Volunteers like you are making a real difference in your communities by helping people stay safe. Everyone at HelpMyStreet is grateful to you for taking care of them.</p>

<p>To start accepting requests, you'll need to verify your identity.</p>

<p>You can do this now by visiting your <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/profile">Profile Page</a> and clicking the green 'Confirm ID' button.</p>

<p>The process takes just a few minutes. All you need is a passport or driving license and the Yoti app, which you can download for free from your iphone app store or android google play store.</p>

<p>HelpMyStreet.org has chosen to partner with Yoti to verify the identity of our volunteers. Yoti is a trusted digital identification service that provides a fast, secure and free way to verify your identity. You can find out more about ID verification and Yoti in our <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/questions#2">FAQs</a>.</p>

<p>If there's a problem and you’re unable to verify your identity, let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:feedback@helpmystreet.org">feedback@helpmystreet.org</a>.</p>

<p>Once you're verified, you'll be able to accept help requests from people in your area. To find open requests go to the <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/open-requests">Open Requests</a> tab in your profile. We’ll also email you when new requests come in near you.</p>

<p>Once you’ve accepted a request, it will appear in your <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/accepted-requests">My Accepted Requests</a> tab, so you can keep track of your open requests. From here you can mark a request as complete, or if needed, return it for other volunteers to pick up. If you see a request that can’t be completed, e.g. the contact details don’t work or the request is no longer needed, please let us know by contacting <a href="mailto:support@helpmystreet.org">support@helpmystreet.org</a>.</p>

<p>If there’s someone you’re worried about, anywhere in the UK, feel free to submit a Help Request for them.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback about our site, the registration journey, or what you’d like to see next, please email us at <a href="mailto:feedback@helpmystreet.org">feedback@helpmystreet.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks again for being part of our community and helping people in need.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>The Help My Street Team</p>
