<p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

<p>Thanks for registering as a volunteer with HelpMyStreet – we’re so pleased to have you on the team!</p>

<p>Most requests will need you to be ID verified before you can accept them and help, this to keep you and the people who use our site safe.</p>

<p>You can verify your identity now by visiting your <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/profile">Profile Page</a> and clicking the green 'Confirm ID' button.</p>

<p>The process takes just a few minutes. All you need is a passport or driving license and the Yoti app, which you can download for free from the App Store (for Apple) or Google Play (for android).</p>

<p>For more information about ID verification and Yoti visit our <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/questions#2">FAQs</a></p>

<p>Please be aware that some requests may require additional checks or have alternative options to verify your ID depending on who is managing the request. More information is available when you click to accept a request.</p>

<p>To find open requests go to the <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/open-requests">Open Requests</a> tab in your profile or check your inbox for email updates. Once you’ve accepted a request, it will appear in your <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/account/accepted-requests">My Accepted Requests</a> tab, so you can keep track of your open requests. From here you can mark a request as complete or click ‘Can’t Do’ to let us know if there’s a problem.</p>

<p>Thanks again for volunteering with us.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>The HelpMyStreet Team</p>

<p>P.S. Don’t forget that you can submit a request for help at any time if there’s someone far away from home that you’re worried about. Complete our <a href="{{BaseUrl}}/request-help">Request Help</a> form and let us know what they need.</p>
