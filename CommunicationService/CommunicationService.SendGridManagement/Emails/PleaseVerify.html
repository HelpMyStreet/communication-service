        <p>Hi {{FirstName}},</p>

        <p>Thanks for being one of the first people to register with HelpMyStreet!</p>

        <p>We've built a platform to make volunteering easier and safer. At the moment we can match volunteers to people who need help, but there is much more coming soon..</p>

        <p>Over the coming weeks we are looking to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Update the request for help form to include questions tailored to each activity type – helping to collect more of the information you need up front
            <li>Allow users to track their requests for help so they know what is going on
            <li>Prioritise incoming requests to ensure the most important and time-sensitive are dealt with first
            <li>Release interactive maps so users can see where help is needed in their area
            <li>Introduce groups so you can show your support for voluntary groups which are already doing great work in your community
        </ul>
        <p>To start receiving requests you'll need to verify your identity. It only takes a few minutes, all you need is a passport or driving license and the Yoti app - you can download the app for free from your device's app store. Verify now by logging into helpmystreet.org and clicking 'Confirm ID' from your profile.</p>

        <p>HelpMyStreet.org has chosen to partner with Yoti and verify the identity of our volunteers to help protect our users, including volunteers and the people they help. Yoti is a trusted digital identification service that provides a fast, secure and free way to verify your identity. You can find out more about ID verification and Yoti in our FAQs.</p>

        <p>If there has been a problem and you’re unable to verify your identity let us know by replying to this email or contacting feedback@helpmystreet.org.</p>

        <p>Once you're verified you'll be able to receive help requests from people in your area. To find open requests go to the ‘Open Requests’ tab in your profile. We’ll also email you when new requests come in near you. Once you’ve accepted a request it will appear in the ‘My Accepted Requests’ tab so you can keep track of your open requests. From here you can mark a request as complete, or if needed, return it to the open requests tab for other volunteers to pick up. If you believe a request can’t be completed by any volunteer, perhaps the contact details don’t work or the request is no longer needed, let us know by contacting requests@helpmystreet.org.</p>

        <p>It might take some time for people to start using our site, but please keep an eye out for incoming requests. We’re starting to go bigger with our publicity and we hope to be helping lots of people near you very soon. And if there’s someone you’re worried about, please do submit a request – if we haven’t got an area covered we’ve got a dedicated team ready to find volunteers.</p>

        <p>Thank you for being a part of our community and helping your street.</p>

        <p>Best wishes,</p>
        <p>Laura from the Help My Street Team</p>
